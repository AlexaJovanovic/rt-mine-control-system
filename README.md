# RT Mine Control System

**Real-time Mine Control & Monitoring System** — a university project that simulates a mine environment, monitors parameters in real time, and provides a GUI for control and testing.

> This repository is implemented in Java and contains the source under `src/com/prv`.

## Features
- Real-time environment simulation (gas levels, temperature, air flow, water flow etc.)
- Control logic that reacts to sensor data and implements basic on/off regulation
- GUI for monitoring and manual control of the pump
- Alerting mechanisms for threshold breaches
- Designed as an educational project for real-time systems
